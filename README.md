# Hey there, I am Burak. üßë‚Äçüíª
# I am Flutter Developer

An Article App using New York Times API
I used ; 
* MVVM as a pattern
* Provider as a state management
* REST API as fetching data

# API Usage

* We'll be using the most viewed section of this API. Note: you need to signup for an API key
at: https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started, then replace the ‚Äòsample-key‚Äô below with
the API key assigned to your account.
* http://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/{period}.json?api-key=sample-key
* To test this API, you can change the period section of the path (available period values are 1,
7 and 30, which represents how far back, in days, the API returns results for).
* https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/7.json?api-key=sample-key

# How Can You Pull Project
First, you'll need to tell git about yourself. Get your username and token together from your settings page.

Then run:

* git config --global github.user YOUR_USERNAME
* git config --global github.token YOURTOKEN
* You will need to generate a new key if you don't have a back-up of your key.

Then you should be able to run:

* git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT.git

# How Can You Build App
it is recommended to use Android Studio as you code editor, which can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq_D7BRADEiwAVMDdHjI_Lu5xR1whSMHH-WDMO3x6WDQVbBcZxbhN9h6m9SsT6b_wjmuKkhoCbSwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). To complete the iOS deployment steps you will also need to have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed. The last piece you will need to set up before beginning this project is the set up of an [iOS simulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-ios-simulator) as well as an [Android emulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-android-emulator). Once these sets have been completed you are ready to start building the app in your pc.
