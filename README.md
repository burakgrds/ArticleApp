# How Can You Build App
it is recommended to use Android Studio as you code editor, which can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq_D7BRADEiwAVMDdHjI_Lu5xR1whSMHH-WDMO3x6WDQVbBcZxbhN9h6m9SsT6b_wjmuKkhoCbSwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). To complete the iOS deployment steps you will also need to have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed. The last piece you will need to set up before beginning this project is the set up of an [iOS simulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-ios-simulator) as well as an [Android emulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#set-up-the-android-emulator). Once these sets have been completed you are ready to start building the app in your pc.
